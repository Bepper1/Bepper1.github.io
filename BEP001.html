<p align="center" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px; font-size:24pt; font-weight:600;"><br /></p>

<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In many games, players can accumulate wealth by collecting resources, battling opponents, solving puzzles, or simply surviving. In Dungeons &amp; Dragons, players can kill monsters and loot their corpses. In online games, players can complete tasks to earn in-game money. In Monopoly, players attempt to accumulate counterfeit bank notes. All of these in-game currencies function as money within the game itself, but player-to-player trading can give these currencies a real-world value.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:16pt; font-weight:600;">Scarcity and price</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For example, a broke Dungeons &amp; Dragons player might want to buy a +5 Vorpal Sword of Demon Slaying badly enough to offer another player a few dollars in exchange for some in-game gold. A Monopoly player could attempt to avoid bankruptcy by offering to trade another player a few real dollars for a stack of Monopoly dollars. Many players of online games buy in-game money, either directly from the game company or from other players on the side. It is important to note that many in-game currencies have achieved a real-world exchange rate, despite being completely intangible. The price players are willing to pay for an in-game currency is strongly affected by its scarcity. </p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When a dead monster is looted in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the dungeon master determines (often by rolling dice) how many coins are awarded to the player (and thus added to the existing total supply). A computer game can be programmed to create new in-game currency whenever a player performs a certain action. A Monopoly board game comes with a fixed amount of paper notes, but the banker can create additional money as needed. In each of these cases, the in-game currency supply is infinite because the dungeon master, game creator, or banker can create more at will, decreasing both scarcity and price.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><span style=" font-size:16pt; font-weight:600;">Bitcoin is a strictly scarce in-game currency</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bitcoin is an in-game currency for the game of bitcoin mining. Currently, bitcoin miners expend enormous amounts of computational power in a competition for ever-decreasing amounts of newly created bitcoin. The new bitcoin is created according to a fixed schedule, so that everyone playing knows the total supply both at present and at any future time, but the final total supply was determined when the game began in 2008. In-game, bitcoin has only one use: Any player can pay a small amount of bitcoin in order to transfer any portion of their balance to another player. Properly executed, these transactions are irreversible, fast, global, secure, uncensorable, private, and provable. Bitcoin has real-world value both because it is strictly and provably scarce, and because it can be easily sent to any other player, anywhere, anytime. (Ideally, players must be able to communicate with each other and with the bitcoin network in order to play. Most use the internet, but many other options are available.) Bitcoin remains predictably and provably scarce because the players operate by consensus-- changing any of the rules requires the consent of every player in the game.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Every player determines which game they are playing by selecting what code they run. Any subset of players can agree to a new set of rules, copy the freely-available bitcoin code, and make whatever changes they like, but this will start a new, different game. The other players can then decide whether to play just the old game, just the new one, or both. Anyone can opt out of any changes by doing nothing at all and continuing to run the original code, never even seeing any of the coins produced in the new game. This ensures that nobody can make more bitcoin by changing the code, all they can do is create another game, and then try to convince others to play along using their altered rule set. This is almost always a bad deal for those players not in charge of the new game, and a great deal for those who are.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even though bitcoin has been running for 10 years now, it is still in beta. Meanwhile, the supply is being distributed to anyone who chooses to buy some. Soon, bitcoin will represent a functional in-game currency for real life. You'll have a virtual money purse that nobody else can even see unless you let them, from which you can send and receive bitcoin to and from whoever you want, from wherever you are, whenever you want. Into, out of, between, or within whatever games you are playing, up to and including real life.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Online, the abbreviation for bitcoin is BTC. If you want some, you can buy it, earn it, or mine it. Just do some research first, and make sure your are buying what you think you are buying. There are over 3000 other games going, and their proponents will try to convince you that their game is better. Some will tell you that their game is the &quot;real&quot; bitcoin. Play these other games if you want to, but be careful. Investigate all of the new rules and decide for yourself: Why were rule changes needed, what trade-offs were made, and are the new rules really better? I'll save you some time: The changes were made to enrich those who made them, the trade-offs are usually ill-advised, and no, the new rules are worse for the new player. For example, is it fun playing Monopoly with a banker who constantly cheats?</p>
